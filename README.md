This repository contains my SQL learning journey as I work through assignments and exercises provided by my offline institute. It serves as a collection of solutions that showcase my progress and understanding of SQL concepts, including:  

- **Basic SQL Queries**: SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, etc.  
- **Joins and Subqueries**: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and nested queries.  
- **Data Manipulation**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements.  
- **Database Design**: Creating and managing tables, constraints, and relationships.  
- **Advanced SQL**: Window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization techniques.
- **Projects**: SQL Practice projects

This repository is a work in progress, and I will keep updating it with new solutions and learnings as I advance in the course.  

Feel free to explore and use it for reference! Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. ðŸ˜Š
